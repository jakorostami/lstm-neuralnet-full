# lstm-neuralnet-full
Code used in my thesis where we built and LSTM model.
Special thanks to Matt Dancho @<link>https://github.com/mdancho84</link> for his tutorial on LSTMs in R with including code on how to build one.
The code in this repo is modified to fit my Bachelor's thesis and also because alot of the code written my Matt did not work somehow.

<b>This is the code used in my Bachelor's thesis: "Time Series Forecasting of House Prices: An evaluation of a Support Vector Machine and a Recurrent Neural Network
with LSTMS cells"</b>
